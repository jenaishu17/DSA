Subject: Request for Permission to Wear Slippers Due to Torn Black Shoe

Respected Sir/Madam,

I request permission to wear slippers to college for the next few days, as my black shoe has torn and is unusable. Being a hosteller, I will purchase a new pair by next week.

This is a temporary measure, and I assure you my attire will remain appropriate.

Thank you for your consideration.
